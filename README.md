# Simple Python Chatbot 🤖

This is a basic Python-based chatbot that can respond to simple user inputs. It's designed for learning purposes and demonstrates how to use conditional logic and randomness in responses.

## 🧠 Features

- Greets the user on "hi"
- Bids farewell on "bye"
- Handles unrecognized inputs with a default message
- Runs in a continuous loop until the user types `quit`

## 📋 How It Works

1. The bot listens for user input via the console.
2. It matches the input with a predefined set of responses.
3. If a match is found (e.g., "hi" or "bye"), it responds randomly from the matching list.
4. If no match is found, it responds with a default fallback message.
5. Typing `quit` ends the chat.

## 🔧 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-chatbot.git
cd simple-chatbot
python chatbot.py
```

You'll see a prompt like this:

```
You: hi
Bot: Hi there!
```

To exit the chat, type:

```
You: quit
```

## 🗂️ Files

- `chatbot.py`: The main Python file that contains the chatbot logic.
- `README.md`: This file – documentation for the project.

## 📌 Example Interaction

```
You: hi
Bot: Hello!
You: how are you?
Bot: I'm not sure what you mean. Could you please provide more context?
You: bye
Bot: See you later!
You: quit
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add more keywords and responses
- Implement NLP for better understanding
- Integrate with a GUI or web interface
